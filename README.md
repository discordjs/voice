## About

An implementation of the Discord Voice API for Node.js, written in TypeScript.

**Features:**

- Send and receive* audio in Discord voice-based channels
- A strong focus on reliability and predictable behaviour
- Horizontal scalability and libraries other than [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) are supported with custom adapters
- A robust audio processing system that can handle a wide range of audio sources

\**Audio receive is not documented by Discord so stable support is not guaranteed*
