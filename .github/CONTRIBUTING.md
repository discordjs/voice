# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in [GitHub Discussions (preferred)](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/discussions) or the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the @discordjs/voice codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent coding style, so having those set up in your editor of
choice is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `npm run lint` to run ESLint
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/discordjs/voice/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js-next/blob/master/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
